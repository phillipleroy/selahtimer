     - Living as Christians (10 min default)
     - Congregation Bible Study (30 min default)

3. **Review Your Start Time**

   - You can customize the start time if needed by toggling "Customize start time"

4. **Adjust Duration**
   - Fine-tune the timer duration using the stepper control

## Using the Timer

### Timer Controls

- **Start**: Begin the countdown when you're ready to start your assignment
- **Pause**: Temporarily stop the timer
- **Resume**: Continue the timer after pausing
- **Stop**: End the timer and reset to ready state
- **Edit**: Modify your assignment settings

### Timer Display Modes

The timer shows different information depending on its current state:

- **Ready**: Shows your configured assignment and start time, waiting for you to start
- **Running**: Active countdown with remaining time displayed prominently
- **Paused**: Timer is temporarily stopped
- **Completed**: Your assignment time has finished

### Late Start Adjustment

If you start the timer after your scheduled start time, Selah Timer automatically adjusts the remaining time to keep you on track. For example, if your assignment was supposed to start at 19:45 and you start the timer at 19:50, the app will subtract 5 minutes from your duration.
